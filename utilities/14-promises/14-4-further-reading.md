Matt Greer’s [JavaSript Promises... In Wicked Detail](http://www.mattgreer.org/articles/promises-in-wicked-detail/) builds up a \(non-Angular\) Promise implementation

with an approach very similar to this book.

Kyle Simpson’s [Promises chapter in “You Don’t Know JS: Async & Performance](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20&%20performance/ch3.md) is a well-written,

thorough guide to using Promises in JavaScript. Though Angular’s Promises have a slightly different

API to the ES6 Promises used here, pretty much all of the content translates directly to $q.

Kris Kowal’s [A General Theory of Reactivity](https://github.com/kriskowal/gtor) does a great job putting Promises in the bigger

context of “reactivity”, and compares and contrasts them with other asynchronous computation

primitives, such as Observable Streams.
